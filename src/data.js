      "The project I worked on for the HND in computing \"User Experience & interface design\" module was focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for an online music platform. The project was valuable because it allowed me to gain hands-on experience designing interfaces that prioritize the user's needs and preferences. Through user research and testing, I was able to identify pain points and areas of improvement, which led to a more streamlined and efficient interface. This project taught me the importance of user-centered design and how it can significantly impact the overall success of a product. Creating a positive user experience can increase user satisfaction, retention, and even revenue.",

      "I created a local library website using Django. I found guidance and inspiration from the MDN Web Docs site and followed their Django tutorial to build the website. This project allowed me to practice my web development, database design, and user interface design skills. I learned how to create a dynamic website that allows users to view and search for books in the library. The project also gave me a deeper understanding of Django and how it can be used to create scalable and efficient web applications. I'm excited to continue building my skills and tackling new challenges using the Django framework.",

    subtitle: "React",
    description:
      "Creating this TODO application allowed me to gain hands-on experience in front-end development using ReactJS, one of the most popular front-end libraries. This project taught me how to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces that update in real-time as the user interacts with the app. I also gained experience in state management, event handling, and integrating APIs. This project taught me the importance of building well-structured and maintainable code, which is essential for scalability and future updates. I'm excited to continue exploring the possibilities of ReactJS and other front-end technologies in my future projects.",
